Task Chosen 3: Scraping Data from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook


This task involves scraping:
Profile Data: Followers or following counts.
Post Data: Comments, likes, and possibly more (depending on availability).
Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for the task, the resources needed, and the steps involved for each platform.

1. YouTube
Resources Needed:

YouTube Data API v3: YouTube provides a robust API for retrieving channel data and video comments.

API Key: You'll need to generate an API key from the Google Cloud Console.

Data to Scrape:
Homepage (Channel URL): Subscribers (followers), Channel Information.

Post (Video URL): Comments on the video.

Steps:
Set Up API: Register for an API key at Google Cloud Console.

API Calls: Use youtube.channels().list() to get channel data (subscribers, etc.), and youtube.commentThreads().list() to get comments for videos.

Rate Limiting: YouTube imposes limits on the number of API requests per day, so manage your requests carefully.

Libraries/Tools:
google-api-python-client (to interact with YouTube API).

Install it via pip install google-api-python-client.

3. Instagram
Resources Needed:
Instagram Graph API: This is the official API for interacting with Instagram data, which requires authentication using a Facebook App and access tokens.

Access Token: You need to set up a Facebook App to obtain an Instagram access token.

Data to Scrape:
Homepage (Profile URL): Followers count, Following count.

Post (Post URL): Comments on the post.

Steps:
Set Up Facebook Developer Account: Go to the Facebook Developer Console, create an App, and get the Instagram access token.

API Calls: Use /me or /users endpoint to fetch profile data like followers and following counts. Use /media endpoint to fetch comments for posts.

Handling Permissions: The user needs to grant permissions for your app to access their Instagram data.

Libraries/Tools:

requests (for making API calls).

API documentation: Instagram Graph API Docs.

5. TikTok
Resources Needed:
TikTok API: There are limited options for direct access to TikTok's official API. However, you can use unofficial Python libraries like TikTokApi.

Data to Scrape:
Homepage (Profile URL): Followers count, Following count.

Post (Video URL): Comments on the video.
Steps:
Install TikTok API Library: Use the unofficial TikTokApi package to interact with TikTok.

Install with pip install TikTokApi.

API Calls: Fetch user profile data and video comments using the TikTokApi functions.

Rate Limiting: TikTok doesn't have a strict rate limit but can block IPs if overused. Use with caution.

Libraries/Tools:

TikTokApi (unofficial API wrapper for TikTok).

API documentation: TikTokApi GitHub.

7. Facebook
Resources Needed:
Facebook Graph API: Facebook provides access to user data through the Graph API.

Access Token: You'll need an access token from the Facebook Developer Console.

Data to Scrape:
Homepage (Profile URL): Followers count (Facebook does not allow scraping following data).

Post (Post URL): Comments on the post.

Steps:
Set Up Facebook Developer Account: Register an app on the Facebook Developer Console to get an access token.

API Calls: Use the /me endpoint for profile data and /comments for post comments.

Handling Permissions: Depending on the data you need (e.g., user posts or followers), the app needs to ask for proper permissions.

Libraries/Tools:

requests (for making API calls).

API documentation: Facebook Graph API Docs.

---------------------------------------------------------

Data Flow and Workflow:

---------------------------------------------------------
User Input: The user provides a URL (either a profile URL or post URL).

Check URL Type:
If it's a profile URL, prompt the user to choose whether they want followers or following data.
If it's a post URL, scrape the comments and possibly likes.

Scraping Logic: Based on the URL type (profile or post), use the respective API calls to retrieve the necessary data.

Display Output: The data is either printed or saved to a file, depending on the user's preference.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python (due to its excellent libraries for scraping and handling APIs).

Libraries:

requests: For making HTTP requests to the APIs.

google-api-python-client: For interacting with YouTube.

TikTokApi: For scraping TikTok.

facebook-sdk or requests: For Facebook scraping.

Authentication:

For Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, you will need API keys or tokens to authenticate requests.

For TikTok, you will rely on an unofficial API library (TikTokApi).
